My website we through a lot of different style changes through out development. There's a home page, about, portfolio, and contact form.




My first step was choosing a colour pallette and typography. I used Lato for headings and Montesserant for body. I chose to use a picture and developed the colour pallette from that. Thes are the photo's I was initialliy drawing inspo from.

I ended up creating a figma collage drawing huge inspiration from this image.

## Figma

 Using the picutre of the elephant in various forms. Headings, backgrounds, in the text. It was brilliant and I had put a lot of effort into the design trying to make it as asethly perfect as I could.

## MVP

This was a mistake and my end product went through a lot of changes and challenges because of this. Which is a good lesson to learn. In retrospect I should have done an MVP and gone from there. The image was too complex to manipaulte in my limited coding ability.
